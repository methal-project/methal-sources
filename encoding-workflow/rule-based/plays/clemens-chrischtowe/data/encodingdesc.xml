            <p>The semi-colon that seaparates character names from their descriptions
            in the character description page <hi rend="italics">(Personebeschriewung)</hi>

            <p>Regarding punctuation in the <hi rend="italics">Dramatis Personae</hi>: The original punctuation was kept,
            since one of the early users of the corpus was interested in these marks.
            The play uses a period after character names (and role descriptions if applicable)</p>
